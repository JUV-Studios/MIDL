## How can I help?
If you enjoy using the extension, please give it a ★★★★★ rating on the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace].

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself. This is a personal passion project, so my time is limited.

Another way to help out is to [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/madskristensen).
